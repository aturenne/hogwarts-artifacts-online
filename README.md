# hogwarts-artifacts-online
Hogwarts Artifacts Online is a sample back-end application designed to demonstrate typical use cases and best practices in Spring Boot development.

In addition to exploring the features of Spring Boot, the course delves into essential software engineering practices. We will start by framing user stories, then move on to crafting REST APIs and applying object-oriented design principles. Embracing test-driven development, we will meticulously build and refine each feature. The culmination of this journey is setting up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, ensuring smooth deployment of the application.
